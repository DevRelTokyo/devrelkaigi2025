# Code of Conduct

All DevRelKaigi organizers, participants, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers must agree to the following Code of Conduct. The organizers will enforce these rules throughout the event. With the cooperation of all participants, we expect to ensure a safe environment for everyone.

## In short: Refrain from behavior that would make you disliked

### Need support?

If you encounter or witness harassment, you can always contact us at [2025@devrelkaigi.org](mailto:2025@devrelkaigi.org).

## Short Version

We are committed to providing an event and conference free of harassment for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, physical appearance, body size, race, religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of any participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any event venue, including conferences, workshops, parties, and online media such as X (Twitter). Participants violating these rules may be expelled from the venue at the discretion of the organizers without a refund.

## Long Version

This includes verbal comments that are uncomfortable regarding sexual orientation, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes or create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a staff member immediately.

### Conference

Conference staff can be identified by their special T-shirts or uniforms. If you prefer, you can also contact us by email at [2025@devrelkaigi.org](mailto:2025@devrelkaigi.org).

Conference staff will work to ensure your safety during the event, including contacting venue security or local law enforcement, providing escorts, and supporting those experiencing harassment. We value your participation.

Participants are expected to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and at all conference-related social events.

### Event

If you are harassed or notice that someone else is being harassed, please contact an [organizer](/en/#organizer).
